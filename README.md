# About Me

I'm basically a Nerd who loves being creative. I use programming as a tool to frameworks, games, message boards, encryption, chats, and the works. I used my Nerd powers to build what I please and if I don't know something I develop a project using the technology in question. Nothing blocks me from building or learning with this nerdy mindset. I also ride a bike I call a Trail Hog and engage in extreme programming.
